SoundPool seems to suffer from crashes on the Samsung Galaxy S2 (and possibly other dual core handsets). While waiting for an official fix, some have suggested as a workaround to use OpenSL ES for audio on 2.3 devices.

This project provides an OpenSL ES based replacement for SoundPool. It doesn't currently have all SoundPool's features, but may be of use to somebody looking into doing the same.
